# How to Contribute

In order for every developer to work on his own and do not disturb others, we adopt a simple but robust workflow.

## Roles

Only one person among contributors can push to herohu production server. This person is in charge of running post production tests, deployment, post-production migrations if any and check server is up and running.

## Branches

Each new feature should have is own branch following this naming convention : `<username_feature-name>`
