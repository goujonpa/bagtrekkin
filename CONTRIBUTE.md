# How to Contribute

In order for every developer to work on his own and do not disturb others, we adopt a simple but robust workflow.

## Roles

Only one person among contributors can push to herohu production server. This person is in charge of running post production tests, deployment, post-production migrations if any and check server is up and running.

## Branches

### Create a dedicated branch

Each new feature should have its own branch following this naming convention : `<username_feature_name>`. To do so, simply create a new branch by checking out:

```bash
$ git checkout -b roddehugo_my_feature
Switched to a new branch 'roddehugo_my_feature'
```

### Work on your branch

While you're working on your feature, you can commit and push to your branch in order to backup your worktree history.


```bash
$ 
```
